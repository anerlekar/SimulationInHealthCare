# SimulationInHealthCare

A Simulation Technology using Big Data is an important aspect of analyzing
particular data to deduce overall gist of the system and for improvising the legacy
systems. In healthcare particularly, as the actual data are too crucial and confidential,
simulation technology helps in testing the huge amount of data by creating a dummy
data. The purpose is to simulate different machineries that detect different diseases
without knowing actual implementation.
Today an automated simulation system is not available in the market, which can
act like real systems and deduce valuable outcome in a graphical format. Thus
maintaining the records of patient data obtained from numerous testing devices such as
MRI machine, CT-scan, X-Ray machines is a point of concern. Research is also carried
out manually with respect to counting number of patients affected by a particular disease
in a particular healthcare facility, city, state or nation.
In this project we propose how the simulation system would help to understand
the patient's wellness history and demonstrate the use of system in order to help doctors
analyze and diagnose a particular disease using his history of diseases and current test
results graphically. This also will help the healthcare systems to check how the patient
count has been increased or decreased in a particular time period. The graphical
representation would provide an overall gist of the patient record and will help to
research the overall statistics of the patient count for a particular period of time.

Technologies Used: Hadoop MapReduce, Node.js, Javascript, Bootstrap, HTML5 & CSS3.
